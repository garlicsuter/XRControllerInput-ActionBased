# XRControllerInput-ActionBased
 Based on the YouTube tutorial by Fist Full of Shrimp here: https://youtu.be/Kh_94glqO-0
 
 To use: Create an empty gameobject and add the scripts "TriggerInputDetector" (from Scripts folder) and "inputdata" (FFOS Tutorial Resources folder,  then FFOSControllerData folder) onto it. Assign the Canvas texts to see the values in game view, not just debug log.
